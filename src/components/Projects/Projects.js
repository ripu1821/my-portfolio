        "In the food delivery app backend built with NestJS, we have implemented a range of APIs to facilitate various functionalities. For user management, we have endpoints for user registration, login, profile update, and password management, including forgot password functionality. The product category API allows for managing and retrieving different food categories available in the app. The offer API enables the creation, retrieval, and management of special offers and discounts for users. The cart API allows users to add, remove, and update items in their shopping cart. For payments, we have integrated APIs to handle payment processing securely. These APIs collectively form a robust backend system to power the food delivery app, providing a seamless experience for both users and administrators. #We have also implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to secure the APIs. When a user successfully logs in or registers, a JWT token is generated and sent back to the client. This token is then included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The backend verifies the JWT token to ensure that the request is coming from an authenticated user. If the token is valid, the request is processed; otherwise, an unauthorized error is returned. This approach ensures that only authenticated users can access protected APIs, providing a secure environment for the food delivery app.",

        "In NestJS projects, a common API pattern for JWT token management and user logout handling using Redis is essential for ensuring secure authentication and session management. This API typically includes endpoints for token creation, validation, and revocation. Upon user logout, the JWT token is added to a Redis blacklist, preventing its reuse and enhancing security. By integrating Redis, developers can efficiently manage token blacklists and revoke tokens, ensuring that expired or compromised tokens cannot be used to access protected resources. This approach not only enhances security but also improves performance by offloading token validation to a fast, in-memory cache. Overall, this API pattern is foundational in many NestJS projects, providing a robust and secure authentication mechanism.",
